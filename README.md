# surphop

This is a Flutter App for Android and iOS that allows you to track your
learning progress by uploading short videos (less than 5 min) of your daily
learning activity.

I made this app for myself and really helped me to improve my guitar skills
and my latte art skills. The key is that the app allows you to see small
progress that otherwise is not easy to see and with this it helps you
to avoid frustration.

I think it will be nice to allow people to share this progress and help 
other people. SURPHOP means Save Your Progress and Help Other People.

Unfortunatelly it will require a lot of money to put this on production
so here I share the idea and the code.
